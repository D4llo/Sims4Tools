Helper Projects
-------------
* I'm moving most of the helpers to a new repository, [s4pe-helper] because it is much easier to manage. However, most of them will be shipped with the S4PE build.

#### Special thanks:
Without peter's help and work on s3pe/s3pi project, there won't be this project, which highly depends on his two projects. His philosophy to share and distribute open source project will be carried on.
